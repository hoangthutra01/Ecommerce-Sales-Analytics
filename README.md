# Ecommerce Sales Analytics
The data set includes information about customers and orders from an e-commerce store. The data set includes 2 data tables: a table containing data about customer information and a table containing data about orders.

The customer data table includes information about customer ID, customer name, customer segment, state, and city.

The order data table includes information about store ID, order date, category, market segment, region, quantity, price, and profit.

I have cleaned both of these data tables using Bigquery. I then imported the 2 cleaned data tables to PowerBI to visualize the data.
